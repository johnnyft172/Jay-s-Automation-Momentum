        //HashMap is a class implements Map Interface
        //Extends AbstractMap
        //IQ: It contains only unique elements
        //Stores the values - key - value pair
        //it may have one null key and multiple null values
        //It maintains no order
        /*HasmMap is non-synchronised - means if it is used in multi threading environment or multi threading concept, if you are using more than one thread
        can access and process the HashMap simultaneously. It means there are multiple threads that are running on. Then HashMpa object can be accessed by all the
        thread so the performance of the HashMap will be increased automatically. Because whenever you have to use fast performance system in that case, we
        have to use HashMap. We don't use HashTable because HashTable is synchronized with thread safe, it means in HasTable one thread at a time can access HashTable
        object. However, HashMap can be accessed accessible by multiple threads. It means HashMap is non-synchronized, it is not thread safe. It means multiple threads
        can attack, multi-threading environment, if you want to use multiple threads that are available and then they want to use multiple users script, if you are
        creating and they want to use this particular HashMap object, they you can access it. But there is a problem with HashMap and this is very very important for
